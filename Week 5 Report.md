### What have you done this week?  
\- Modified the tests for Miller-Rabin to use actually verified large prime numbers  
\- Added a 257-character string to [test_encrypt_decrypt.py](./test/test_encrypt_decrypt.py) to ensure that the algorithm can at least encrypt and decrypt strings of length up to 256 characters  
\- Slightly modified [generate.py](./generate.py) to ensure that the generated keys are at least 1024 bits long  
\- Added a CLI for the program: [main.py](./main.py)  
\- Updated [Testing.md](./Testing.md) to actually detail the data used to test Miller-Rabin
