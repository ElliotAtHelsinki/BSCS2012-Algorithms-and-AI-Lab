### What have you done this week?
I initiliased the repository, registered the repository in Labtool, and chosen a topic for the course.
    
### How has the project progressed?
So far I have not written any actual code. I'm currently reading on how RSA encryption works and how it is implemented, step by step. Once I have a firm understanding of what needs to be done, I will start working on the code immediately.

### What did you learn this week / today?
RSA encryption and related mathematical algorithms.

### What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.
So far, nothing. I am confident that I will be able to complete this project. If there are any troubles, I will contact the course assistant immediately.

### What next?
I will read up on any algorithms necessary to implement RSA encryption, and once I know how they work, I will immediately start writing code.
