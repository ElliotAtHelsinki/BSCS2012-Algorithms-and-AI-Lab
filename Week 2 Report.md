### What have you done this week?

\- Implemented a basic RSA key generator
\- Configured [pylint](https://gamedevacademy.org/pylint-tutorial-complete-guide/) to assess code quality
\- Configured unit tests for the developed functions (Miller-Rabin test and Extended Euclidean Algorithm)
\- Configured [coverage](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-unit-testing/python-unittest-coverage/) to check that the unit tests have sufficient coverage

### How has the project progressed?

A basic RSA key generator has been developed. Unit tests for the Miller-Rabin test and Extended Euclidean Algorithm have also been written.

### What did you learn this week / today?

\- Miller-Rabin test
\- Extended Euclidean Algorithm
\- [pylint](https://gamedevacademy.org/pylint-tutorial-complete-guide/)
\- [unittest](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-unit-testing/python-run-unittest/)
\- [coverage](https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-unit-testing/python-unittest-coverage/)

### What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

So far, nothing. I am confident that I will be able to complete this project. If there are any troubles, I will contact the course assistant immediately.

### What next?

\- The `encrypt(text: str, n: int, e: int) -> str` and `decrypt(text: str, d: int) -> str` funcions will be developed.
\- The Testing.md document will be updated.
\- If I receive any feedback or suggestion about a missing feature, I will consider implementing it.
\- Bug fixes (as necessary)
