### What have you done this week?  
\- The `encrypt(text: str, n: int, e: int) -> str` and `decrypt(text: str, d: int, n: int) -> str` funcions have been developed.  
\- A unit test to make sure the key generator correctly returns the public and private keys has been written.  
\- A unit test to make sure that the encrypt and decrypt functions work correctly has been implemented.  
\- The [Testing.md](./Testing.md) document has been updated.  
\- The [User Guide.md](./User%20Guide.md) document has been updated.  
\- Added [.pylintrc](./.pylintrc)  

### How has the project progressed?
Most of the main functionalities and tests have been implemented. I might consider developing additional features like a GUI for the program. If I receive any feedback or suggestion about a missing feature, I will also consider implementing it.

### What did you learn this week / today?  
Options for [.pylintrc](./.pylintrc)

### What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

So far, nothing. I am confident that I will be able to complete this project. If there are any troubles, I will contact the course assistant immediately.

### What next?
\- (Potentially) developing a simple GUI for the program  
\- Optimising the code to improve pylint ratings  
\- Updating the [Specification.md](./Specification.md) document after everything has been completed  
\- Responding to feedback and suggestions (if any)  
\- Bug fixes (as necessary)
