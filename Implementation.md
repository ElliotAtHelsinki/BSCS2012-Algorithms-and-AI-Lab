### The general structure of the program.

### The time and space complexities achieved (e.g., Big O analyses from pseudocode).


### Potentially, performance and Big O analysis comparison (if applicable to the topic).

### Potential shortcomings and suggested improvements of the work.

### Use of extensive language models (ChatGPT, etc.) State which model was used and how. Also, state if you have not used one. This is important!
